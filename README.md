RotLike

Come up with way to show tiles in expected color (specific light colors that force this or something)
    Maybe set the color as the max brightness and cap it out at that
NPC's unmoving, with text telling you how they are eying you
Log levels (color) so that we can be descriptive but allow for quick reading of important things
Color code sounds (squish squish, splash) as they have an effect
